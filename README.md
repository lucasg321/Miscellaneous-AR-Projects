A few other AR projects made with Google ARCore, Vuforia, and Unity

**AR Picture Recognition:** 
An app takes input from the users camera and recognizes an image that was uploaded to a Vuforia database. When a pre-uploaded image is recognized, various 3-D objects are spawned and interact with movement and collision detection scripts.
